How to Reset an Unreal Editor project in case there's a consistent crash
1. "Check-out" or "Reset" to a working commit
2. Delete derived folders and files -> .vs, Binaries, Build, Intermediate, Save, top level .sln, top levle .VC.DB
3. Open unreal editor from .uproject, right click .uproject -> "generate visual studio project files"
4. Open new .sln file in Visual Studio to re-build the derived folders/files
