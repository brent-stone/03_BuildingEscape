When modifying Unreal generated C++, the last #include must be the *.generated.h
When modifying Unreal .cpp generated classes, make sure the associated .h is the FIRST #include

Hold L and double click to insert point light
Alternatively, Shift+L and single click

Don't forget to set object to movable in the Transform pane of the Details window before attempting to rotate, translate, scale.

Sometimes assets won't automatically have a collision volume. To add one click the asset -> Details windows Static Mesh pane -> Magnifying Glass -> Colission menu in the editor that's opened.

How to Reset an Unreal Editor project in case there's a consistent crash
1. "Check-out" or "Reset" to a working commit
2. Delete derived folders and files -> .vs, Binaries, Build, Intermediate, Save, top level .sln, top levle .VC.DB
3. Open unreal editor from .uproject, right click .uproject -> "generate visual studio project files"
4. Open new .sln file in Visual Studio to re-build the derived folders/files


<> for generics
	Example: PhysicsHandle = GetOwner()->FindComponentByClass<UPhysicsHandleComponent>();
	Example Explanation: This code is in a component of player's pawn. Go up to owner (the player pawn), then find a sibling component of the UPhysicsHandleComponent class and return it.

nullptr to initialise pointers

To add physics to a pawn open the pawn BluePrint -> CollisionComponent component -> Physics Pane inside details and click "simulate physics" -> give a Mass in Kg -> Collision Pane click "Simulation Generates" -> "Simulation Generates Hit Events" && "Generate Overlap Events" radio buttons are checked

Wrapping up dereferences matters. Notice the brackets around GetOwner()->GetName() results in the dereference not working as intended
Works: UE_LOG(LogTemp, Error, TEXT("No Physics Handle found for %s"), *GetOwner()->GetName());
Doesn't: UE_LOG(LogTemp, Error, TEXT("No Physics Handle found for %s"), *(GetOwner()->GetName()));
